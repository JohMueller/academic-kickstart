# Data Science for the Public Good.

I am a social entrepreneur, data analyst and social scientist.

I founded the social start-up [CorrelAid](www.correlaid.org), a network of 650 data scientists which helps mission-driven organisations to increase their impact with data science. Currently I am also a fellow at the [Hertie Center for Advanced Practitioners](http://hertie-innovationskolleg.de/).

I studied at the [University of Oxford](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/) and [University Konstanz](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/) at the intersection of social science and statistics. My academic interests include evidence-based policies, causal inference, and computational methods in the social sciences. As a data analyst I worked with international organizations such as the [Skoll Center for Social Entrepreneurship](http://skoll.org/organization/skoll-centre-for-social-entrepreneurship/), the [Said Business School](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/programmes/oxford-scenarios-programme), and the [HIV/AIDS Alliance](http://www.aidsalliance.org/).

I also educate decision-makers and diverse crowds about the potential of data-driven practices in society. I frequently give talks and workshops; among others at [TEDx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG6sE_oE488&t=141s). Furthermore I participate in expert sessions on topics concerning digitalisation and was named [Ambassador for Digital Engagement](https://www.engagement-macht-stark.de/botschafterinnen/johannes-mueller/) by the [BMFSFJ](https://www.bmfsfj.de/).
