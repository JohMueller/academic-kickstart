# Data Science for the Public Good.

I am a social entrepreneur, a data analyst and a social scientist. 
I founded the social start-up CorrelAid, a network of 650 data scientists which helps mission-driven organisations to increase their impact with data science. 
As a data analyst I worked with international organisations such as the Skoll Center for Social Entrepreneurship, the University of Oxford, and the HIV/AIDS Alliance. 
On the academic side of things I love to think (and write) about evidence-based policies, causal inference, and computational methods in the social sciences. 
In talks, workshops and tutorials I combine those interests and educate diverse crowds on how we can use evidence-based decisionmaking in the civil society.
