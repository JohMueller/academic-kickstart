# Hej!

I am on the mission to help democraticing the potential of data science. This journey has made me a social entrepreneur, a data analyst and a social scientist.

With CorrelAid I founded a network of 650 data scientists which helps mission-driven organisations to increase their impact with data science. As a data analyst I worked with international organisations such as the Skoll Center for Social Entrepreneurship and the HIV/AIDS Alliance. On the academic side of things I love to think (and write) about evidence-based policies, causal inference, 
and computational methods in the social sciences.
