# Data Science for the Public Good.

I am a social entrepreneur, data analyst and social scientist.

I founded the social start-up [CorrelAid](www.correlaid.org), a network of 650 data scientists which helps mission-driven organisations to increase their impact with data science. I am also fellow at the [Hertie Center for Advanced Practitioners](http://hertie-innovationskolleg.de/).

I studied at the [University of Oxford](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/) and [University Konstanz](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/) at the intersection of social science and statistics. My academic interests include evidence-based policies, causal inference, and computational methods in the social sciences. As a data analyst I worked with international organizations such as the Skoll Center for Social Entrepreneurship, the Said Business School, and the HIV/AIDS Alliance.

In talks, workshops, and expert sessions I educate diverse crowds and decision-makers on how we can use evidence-based practices and harness the potential of digitalization in the civil society.
